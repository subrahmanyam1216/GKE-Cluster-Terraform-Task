I have created the Gke private cluster-related details in the Modules folder
modules folder -->  Gke-Cluster > 1. main.tf  2.variable.tf and 3. output.tf files are there.
these modules I have called in GKE.tf and variable.tf.
in GKE.tf file I have created 2 GKE Cluster details and Node pool details as you are given the assignment 
Provider.tf I have given provider-related details
In the GKE cluster creation, we need Network, subnetwork, Firewall, and Service Account details also required. so I have those file details also added to the modules folder
